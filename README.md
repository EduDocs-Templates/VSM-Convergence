# Algorithmic Convergence

This is a simple python challenge to explore the convergence of algorithms.
The main file is `Convergence.ipynb`.
There are also two supporting files `matrix.csv` and `observation.csv`.
Most of the code is already there; the exercise is to use this code to explore properties of algorithms and to then answer related questions.
